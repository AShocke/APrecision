Keep this TODO updated with bugs and intended features

(1) There is an error with the printing format where a number with an
exponent of n only display n numbers after the decimal point.

store: [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ]
exponent: 3
given: 987.654321
expected: 9876.54321

(2) If two numbers are of exponent n, where n is shorter than the store vector size, then the
sum array will have an extra zero due to the trailing zeroes being calculated as digits.
Eg
store 1: [1 2 3] 1 230
store 2: [3 2 1] 3 210
exponent (of both): 3
given: [4 4 4 0] 044.4
expected [4 4 4] 4440
I may have to store the real numbers starting at the start of the numbers instead of backwards
(least place value first)
